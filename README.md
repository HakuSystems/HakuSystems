# Hello, I'm HakuSystems! 👋

I'm Lyze (HakuSystems), a fusion of melodies and code. Music fuels my soul, while developing ignites my passion. In the symphony of life, I find harmony in creating tunes and crafting software. Whether it's hitting the right chord or writing the perfect line of code, I'm all about blending rhythms and algorithms. haha
