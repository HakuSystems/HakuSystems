# üí´ About Me:
Greetings! My name is Lyze, and I was born on July 25, 2001. German is my mother tongue, which is why my English may not be the best. My favorite color is pink, and I enjoy watching drama movies and anime. I listen to all kinds of music, including hardcore and Frenchcore. I have never played popular games, but I have played Elsword, VRChat, and Osu! Elsword is a game I have been playing since I was six years old. In my free time, I enjoy watching YouTube videos. I am also skilled in programming, video editing, Photoshop, Unity, and Fl Studio, among other things.

I am a shy person and I have difficulty reacting when someone wants to talk to me. I also have a tendency to overthink things. I am often late for work or school, which I do not like. I sometimes listen to scream music and I feel the screams very strongly. I often think that I have done something wrong, but usually it turns out to be nothing. I love dogs and I used to have one. I also had a cat, but I prefer dogs. I have ADHD and when people do not like how I act because of my ADHD, I get sad very easily. I always try to be funny, even though I may come across as annoying. This is because when people like the things I say, I continue to do it, but when they do not like it, I get sad and try even harder to make silly comments or say stupid things. By "stupid things," I mean things like "Hitler, please f++ck Obama," and other offensive words.

In conclusion, I am a honest, loyal, and responsible person who likes to talk to everyone. I love the night and hate the morning because of the annoying beeping of the time.
